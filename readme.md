# ðŸš— Flappy Car â€” Pygame Project

Flappy Car is a Python game inspired by Flappy Bird â€” but with a twist: you're flying a **car** through obstacles.  
Built from scratch using **modular Python code** and **Pygame**, this project is designed for clean code structure, easy version tracking, and feature expansion.
